 <h2 class="secand-sec-bluebg">Building performing culture</h2>
 <p>As demands from a diverse workforce evolve, stakeholders’ expectations accelerate, and more competitors disrupt business, organizations continue to struggle to meet strategic priorities amid unclear roles, accountabilities, and poor leadership capability. The result? Research indicates that two-thirds of strategies aren’t successfully executed.</p>

<p>High-performing organizations consider strategy execution a top corporate priority and ensure they have focus, alignment, an engaged workforce, and the right metrics in place. To join their ranks, you need a systematic approach—and the right leaders to drive and develop a high-performance culture that translates your strategy into reality.</p>
