   <p>People Potential Development is the key forte of TPP. We have specialized in this field. This is a complete journey of an individual development.</p>
   <p>Based on job / work requirement , what is Technical Knowledge and skills , Focused Approach , Wisdom and Accountability required. </p>
   <p>Based on analysis, we study the role occupant / the person who is performing or  would be performing in future. We do the complete analysis for present and future both. </p>
   <p>What is the potential as one date, what is the gap and how to bridge up the gap. </p>
   <p>The broad potential development approach is as under : </p>
<ul>
 <li>Collecting data / information about the employee –name, age, qualification, designation , experiences inside and outside, career progression in last 3 years.</li>
 <li>Based on data , the analysis is done with the position the person is occupying. The given position is mapped and analysis is done.</li>
 <li>One on one discussion the correlation is also established. Leading questions are asked and engagement level is judged. </li>
 <li>During the development programme – his / her leadership skill is judged on TPP 10 points – connect, communicate, commitment, involvement, improvement, impact, leading from front, learning process , setting example for others and overall business result.</li>
 <li>There are 6 stake holders in potential development – Self , Senior , Subordinate, customer , HR team and TPP team </li>
 <li>Based on home work and assignment – we also establish the fact and collect data. We do the formal review and discussion after 45 days of intervention and establish the fact.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 120 to 180 days complete people potential development process is completed.</p>
