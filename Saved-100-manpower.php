   <p>TPP  Manpower Requirement Analysis project saved 100 staff manpower  </p>
   
   <p>TPP one of the Auto Component Manufacturing clients was going  for the expansion of the plant and production capacity from 500 MT to 1000 MT per month by merger and acquisition as well as through additional capacity expansion. </p>
   
   <p>As the demand for the staff manpower from the existing Plant Management was very high, the Senior Management Team engaged  TPP  for doing the manpower requirement analysis with <strong>3 clear-cut mandates :</strong></p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>What is the right manpower required for the existing 500 MT</li>
    <li>What would be right manpower required for 1000 MT ( after expansion) </li>
    <li>Existing manpower potential analysis – gap analysis </li>
   </ul>
   
   <p>TPP carried out the detailed study in a systematic manner based on TPPP Model and completed the study within 7 weeks.</p>
   <p>TPP  final finding and recommendations were as under :  </p>
   <ul>
     <li>doing the existing 500 MT  business by engaging  70%  existing manpower</li>
     <li>for the new expansion project , the required manpower was 5 percent less than the existing total staff manpower </li>
     <li>20 percent staff manpower were at right place with right skill</li>
     <li>60 percent staff manpower were at right place , however required skill up gradation – to develop the competence</li>
     <li>20 percent were to move to other place </li>
   </ul>
  <p> At the end of the project, the big fact was revealed that the plant had asked for <strong>additional 100 staff manpower </strong>for the new expansion project </p>
  <p>TPP  carried out the project study covering </p>
  
  <ul>
   <li>1 organization </li>
   <li>22 functions / sections </li>
   <li>200 processes and sub processes </li>
   <li>135 existing staff manpower </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This study was based on TPP  Total People Productivity Performance (TPPP) operating Model, which is based on developing the responsible organization and accountable team. This model is based on Z concept and DDAMAIR ( Define, Develop, Align, Measure, Analyze , Improve and Reward) Approach . </p>
  
  <p>Total 9 formats were used and detailed study was carried out following all 22 functions and 200 processes and sub processes. The people potential analysis was also done. </p>
  
  <p>  Had not this scientific and methodology study been done, the company could have added minimum 70-80  staff additional manpower .</p>
  <p>Similar case is with  number of industries. <strong>We are not able determine the exact manpower requirement – existing and new one based on scientific approach</strong>. This requires a very scientific and detailed study by experts. </p>
