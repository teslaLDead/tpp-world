    <p>TPP has specialized in working with the mid size organization.  Mainly those organizations which are in existence for more than a decade and moved from family ownership to professionals one. Growth is there in the organization, however the breakthrough growth is very much needed .  Many clients also got the ambitious plan to grow. There is good investment opportunity in this secor. 
</p>

<p>There are number of professionals in the organization however not focused. As the organization has grown over the period of time, people have not grown and number of them are in the same mode and state in delivering the services. A challenging one to make them to think out of box. Keep trying and work hard , however difficult for change. There are internal and external challenges. </p> 
<p>Limited number of clients and products.  Keep doing the similar kind of business for number of years. The business baton moved to the next generation of entrepreneur or about to move. New generation finding many thing  not in place as per modern time  in the organization, desperate to grow in the market with new ideas. Old team holding back in growth and legacy created. </p>

<p>Micro and small  organizations are owner driven. So called first generation entrepreneur or Business partners . There are less number of manpower however the business activities remains the same. The work volume is less however the number of activities are many.</p>

<p>In number of cases we have seen that the growth has not been achieved for number of years. Either the business has dipped after a peak or remained stagnate for number of years. In-spite of best efforts the business growth could not take place.</p>

<p>Not able to attract the right kind of manpower due to size as well as paying capacity. All employees very much dependent on promoter and business partners. Keep doing hard work however growth does not take place at given rate. </p>

<p><strong>TPP Association </strong></p>
<p>We work with this organization with promoter or Business Leader in understanding the present and future business challenges.</p>

<p>We do the business potential analysis as well as team members potential analysis. We develop leaders in the department. Mainly people who had been working with the organization for a number of years we mentor and coach them to take up higher responsibility. </p>

<p>Long term and short term business plans are made and teams coached for implementation. All functions of the operation are aligned and team leader accountability is decided. </p>

<p>There is focus on Quality, Cost and Delivery. Meeting customer requirement is the key focused areas. </p>

<p>Roles and responsibility is decided and TPPP model is implemented.  
In case required number of team members are not there in the organization, then we support the promoter in inducting new team members . Placing right manpower in the key strategic areas.</p>

<p>Mentoring and coaching is key thrust. We mentor and coach on periodic basis. Required skill is developed. Mainly business targets are focused to achieve. </p>


<p><strong>Clients’ Result</strong></p> 

<p>There has been slow but certain growth. Within 6 months the sales volume increased and there is improvement in customer demand.</p>
