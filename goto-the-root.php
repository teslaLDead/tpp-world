<p>Get to the root is the mantra of success. We rarely go to the root. We need to understand the reason and symptom of the challenges / problem – why it is happening . we never go to the root and based on our own past experiences or someone else suggestion we do the work or take a decision which sometimes becomes a point of regret or sorrow. We have to go to the root by using tools and technique. For each reason there has to be proper analysis. We cannot adopt the shortcut method  , which is always a trouble for us.  Do the first time right is the mantra of success. Develop alternatives and work on that </p>

<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec">Accept the challenges – follow 3 Is</h3>
<p>There is mantra of 3 Is- Involve, Improve and Impact. We need to start the journey of change from “NO” to be read as “N.O.” –new opportunity. Always we have to see the new opportunity when others say no. get involved and improve the situation whatever is there. We have to get involve and impact the situation with change. This is connecting the hand with heart and head. The mantra of change to be written first. </p>

<div id="b">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-2">Go to the root</span></h3>
<p>Get to the root . use the tool “why- why” seems to be easy however difficult one. When we face any situation , always ask that why this situation has arisen and get to the root . the gut feel would not work , need not to trust on perception , go to the root otherwise the same challenges / problem would arise / emerge again and again and we would not be able to move forward and take up the another challenge. </p>
</div>


<div id="c">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-3">Use of tools and technique</h3>
<p>Data and facts are very important. Without data and facts, whatever decision is taken it is more the gut feel based rather than the fact. It would always be inconsistent and not the sustainable one. Collect all data and information and do the analysis. It would support in understanding the trend and taking the right decision based on data and facts.  The number or majority would not work. Use of data and record always shows the trend and we intend to take the decision based on that. The data need to be more realistic and based on facts. </p>

<div id="d">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-4">Decision making process </h3>
<p>The key differentiator of success and failure is decision making- taking the right decision at the right time. Decision and time both are important. Number of time we take decision however we are not taken on right time. There are number of tools and technique for decision making and we need to use those tools and technique. ABC analysis and matrix diagram or paired compassion are common one. We have to always work with the alternatives. Unless there is alternatives , decision would be not be rational and we would be biased. Always develop Plan “A” and Plan “B”</p>
</div>

<div id="e">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-5">Creativity and innovation</h3>
<p>While making decision and working on any challenges , the creativity and innovation plays an important role. We have to be creative in our approach and actions. Use of SCAMPER method ( Substitute, combine, alter, modify, put to other use, Eliminate and Reverse ) are very common one. We have to keep trying to use these tools and technique. Creativity and innovation is the mantra of success. This would always bring new to the concept and understanding. </p>
