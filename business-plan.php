   <p class="justify">Business plan is the first and foremost important document for any business organization, without which the targets and goals cannot be achieved. This is the apex level document , which guides the short term and long term targets and goals. This is strategic level document. </p>
   <p><strong>Business Plan consist of 2 parts </strong></p>
   <ol>
    <li>Long term Business Plan ( 3 years plan) </li>
    <li>Annual Operating Plan (AoP) </li>
   </ol>
   <p><strong>Long Term Plan </strong></p>
   <p>The long term plan is for key objectives to be decided for 3 years. We mainly include : </p>
   <ol>
    <li>Sales Plan</li>
     <li>New Expansion </li>
      <li>New product launch </li>
       <li>Business diversification</li>
        <li>Profit</li>
         <li>Manpower</li>
          <li>Technical collaboration</li>
           <li>IPO  </li>
            <li>other key parameters</li>
             <li>cost reduction initiatives </li>
              <li>Quality Plan</li>
              <li>Certification Process </li>
   </ol>
   <p class="text-justify">Any project which cannot be completed in one year may be covered under this. As we work on long term plan to meet the future requirement. This is the strategic planning. Even five years plan is prepared, however three years plan is more workable to keep in focus. </p>
  
   <p class="text-justify">While setting the long term plan , the industry best practices are considered and in competitive environment , even the industry best data at international level is taken . Here we suggest to refer the industry best benchmarking data , even from the international market in case the data is present. While setting the target we may consider the optimistic data. </p>
   
   <p>In case benchmarking data is not available then our own last 3 years data (average or best performance )  is taken for the reference and development plan is made.</p>
   
   <p><strong>Annual Operating Plan (AOP)</strong>  </p>
   <p class="text-justify">AOP is prepared for one financial year . this is for the one financial year only. Then we divide the whole target  in <strong>4 Qtrs</strong>. As we are planning the departmental objective on quarterly basis , this is required. It is easier to correct our action based on quarterly plan and review also becomes easy. We have also seen that the Indian industry trend vary from quarter to quarter. The 2nd Qtr and 4th Qtr are better than the 1st and 3rd Qtr. </p>
   
   <p>There are 10-14 parameters related with all departments. Even we can consider the manpower and training for this. </p>
   
   <p>The benchmarking is set based on our long term plan as well as last financial year performance. At certain stage we do compare quarter to quarter performance. </p>
   
   <p><strong>Review mechanism </strong></p>
   <p class="text-justify">The long term Business plan is reviewed on quarterly basis and AOP is reviewed on monthly basis with all departmental head and section head. Once in a quarter the annual plan may be reviewed with all officers and staff. While setting the quarterly plan of the department we may consider the annual plan.<br>&nbsp;</p>
