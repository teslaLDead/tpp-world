<p>Developing Performing Culture – Senior Level </p>

<p>TPP association has been for developing the senior level team members across the group companies at multi locations. The initiative was taken for the building team at the senior level at 4 plants across the country.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges </strong></p>

<p>Team work and coordination have always been challenging one for any organization. Intra and inter department coordination and team work always adds higher value to the business. The need was felt to focus on interpersonal relations and team work.  At the plant level all HoDs were involved in this development programme. 
</p>
<p><strong>TPP intervention and Approach</strong></p>

<p>Based on input and briefing received from the management and plant head, the intervention was designed and developed. The focus was team work, leaders accountability and commitment to deliver the result. The development programme was started in one of the unit. The focus was on 3 Cs and 3Is – connect, communicate, commitment and involve , improve and impact. </p>

<p>Based on adult learning process the programme was designed and delivered. During the progamme leaders were able to connect with each other not at professional level , it was more at the personal level. It was discovered that even after working for more than decade the required bonding could not get developed as there was connection between hand and head, more and more work demand.</p> 

<p>This intervention made them to understand each other need not only at the organization level, it was beyond that and bonding was formed even at family and social. Direct and effective communication was established among all team members. The feedback and suggestions , which were earlier viewed as complaint started being accepted for scope / areas for improvement. Direct communication was established among all members. The accountability was established. The programme had been repeated at all plants. </p>
<p><strong>Impact </strong></p>

<p>There has been direct impact on plant performance and work efficiency. A strong team work and bonding developed. Even the initiative taken for inter plant support and cooperation. The accountability level improved and imitative taken by even those member who were not coming forward.  </p>
