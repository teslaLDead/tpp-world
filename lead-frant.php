<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec">Follow 3 Ls – lead , led and learnt</h3>
<p>We need to lead – led and learnt. We need to follow others as well as make others to follow the same. Whatever people we have or whatever the number of people we have, we need to make other to move and also others to follow you in given area of work and specialization. Always look for an opportunity to come forward and take the initiative. Whatever experiences we have had , we need to share with others. Always followers would not bring the good result. All are capable of doing something let others to follow. </p>
</div>


<div id="b">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-2">Move from group to team</span></h3>
<p>Always form the team not the group. Try to think big and plan big for all. Working in a given pocket or selected people would not be helpful. We may form small team , however group is not desirable. We need not to develop our own agenda and work for that. The decision taken in a team to be honored and respected. There is no need to conflict or compete with each others, the need is to complement and support each others. All decisions are not the correct decision, however once the decision is taken let the team decide or modify. We need to abide by decision taken and follow the same. There is need to be winning attitude for the same. </p>

<div id="c">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-3">Be a team player – move from individual to team</h3>
<p>Team player- very important aspect. We need to form a team and move. Team is always better than the individual. We say that the sum is greater than the number. Be a team player. Even those who don’t intend to come and form the team , call them and make them a part of the team . team always brings the better result. There is shared responsibility and everyone is sharing some part of the responsibility. Team norms are bigger than individual likes and dislikes. While forming team , storming would always be there however we need to normalize and then make it performing. When we start performing then storming gets converted into normalization. Never speak about others back to it , always speak in front in a positive manner. </p>
<div class="resourse"><a href="Be-team-player.php"><p><strong>Be a team player</strong></p></a></div></div>


<div id="d">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-4">Lead from front</h3>
<p>Come forward and take the initiative. All team members need to come forward and take the imitative. It should not be the practice that only selected / nominated leader to perform , however based your specialization and key strength, need to come forward and take the responsibility. Lead the team in one or another way. Always give chance to others to perform and show the result. Everyone is capable one and he / she would perform. The pace or result may be different however positive result would be there. Show respect and patience to others. </p>

<div id="e">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-5">Set an example for others</h3>
<p>Be an individual or team always set an example for others. Let others follow the same. We have to work for legacy of good example. All have got the potential to perform and we have to set example for others to follow. The success stories / good example to be shared among others and let other follows the same. We need keep adding value to the Nation, Society, Organization , Family and self. </p>
