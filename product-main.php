     <p><u>Challenges </u><br>
Organizations have grown over the period of time and engaged the required manpower as the business has grown. As the business expansion takes place or there is less demand of product, there is variation of manpower demand. It becomes very difficult for the management and HR department to determine how many manpower would be required as well as what would be the quality of manpower. How to deploy the required manpower with right talent. A difficult situation emerges , where it is difficult the decide how to proceed for. </p>
<p><u>TPP  approach</u><br>  
TPP based on scientific study and <strong>TPPP approach</strong>, carries out the systematic study and understands the product, process, customer requirements, and technology and work difficult level. </p>

<p>The potential analysis of exiting manpower is also done and competence level is determined. TPP has developed unique method of doing the study through tools and technique. <strong>Z concept and DDAMAIR</strong> approach is used for the same. </p>
<p>We carry out the study of Organization – Functions – Process- People. Starting from Business Plan to work plan study, 9 specialized documents are used and data collected and analyzed. We study all 14 functions , 200 processes and sub processes and all manpower to carry out the study .</p>

<p>The present and future business requirement as well as man, machine, method and material – all 4 M study is done. We understands first the “As Is” position and then “to be”  position is mapped. In depth understanding is carried out. </p>

<p>5 level discussion and interaction takes place at different level and we determined the manpower required. We cover up all levels and understand the manpower requirement. Presentation is made at different levels. We also support in implementation of the project report.</p>
<p><strong>Clients benefits </strong><br>
We have been able to save number of manpower. In our one of the latest study we have been able to save more than 100 manpower. Had this study not been conducted then organization could have added the manpower and overall productivity and performance would have been down.

  <h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg"><strong>Manpower Deployment </strong></h3>
<p><strong>Challenges </strong><br>
Business Sustainability and scalability as well as retention, improvement and breakthrough in work are differentiated through roles and responsibility. It is very important to define the roles and responsibility of each functions based on different levels of employees in the organization. A clear cut understanding is very much required otherwise irrespective of all efforts, organization would not get benefits. The salary and  wages bill would go up however result would not be achieved.  Placing the right person with the right job and accountability is the key challenges. </p>

 <p><strong>TPP approach </strong><br>
TPP understand the given function in the organization along with  inter-department overlaps. Overall product and process flow as well as customer requirement. 
</p>

<p><strong>Process based role matrix</strong> is the mantra of success. Mapping all processes and sub process and preparing the role based on processes is the key thrust areas. </p>

<p>We map all process and difficulty level and based on which the roles and responsibility is defined among team members. It is ensured that none of the processes and sub processes are left out so that there is complete coverage of all areas.  How we can add efficiency and effectiveness to the position. </p>

<p>Along with process based role matrix, we also define the<strong> work plan</strong>.  How to manage, daily, weekly, monthly and yearly activity with report.  Reports to be generated is also mapped for. </p>

<p><strong>Client Benefits </strong><br>
Clients have benefited from the defined roles and responsibility. It has not only brought the role clarity , it has added to the productivity and performance. The role ambiguity has been eliminated and level specific roles and responsibility has been defined.  Value add , value paid has been emphasized. Functional and operational efficiency has been improved by focusing on value added and non value added activity. Work efficiency has improved.

<p><strong>Challenges</strong><br> Building performance culture in the organization is the key challenges for the organization.  Aligning the business goals and targets with the individual  key performance index is the challenging one. There is need to align the business plan with departmental objective and individual KRAs ( Key Result Areas). It has to be set on time and measured the performance on periodic basis. This is very much required to achieve the desired business result. The rating points are also linked with the rewards and recognition , therefore there has to <strong>be SMART approach</strong> and objectivity. </p>
<p><strong>TPP Approach </strong><br>
TPP follows the TPPP operating models setting targets and goals. Based on business plan and departmental objective the individual key performance index / key performance areas are discussed and decided. SMART target are set and it is decided for a given period of time, preferably on quarterly basis.</p>

<p>TPP works through the workshop approach , where starting from vision and mission the current year plus 3 years the business plan is decided and annual operating plan ( AoP) is prepared. The department objective is also finalized and then the individual KRAs / targets are decided. The major focus is improvement and breakthrough. The level based targets are set and difficulty level is also decided.</p>

<p>TPP supports in periodic review and appraisal. Time to time as per business requirement, the key result areas as well as targets are redefined and targets are achieved. Periodic feedback and counseling is imparted. TPP team provides the feedback and support.</p>

<p><strong>Clients benefit</strong><br>
Over the period of 2-3 years , the organization has achieved the breakthrough result. There has been focused approach. More than 200 percent growth in sales as well in margin has been achieved through this process. There is trust and transparency in the organization  . Rewards and recognition is given as per the value add /contribution. Career progression and growth has also been decided based on performance system.</p>

  <h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg"><strong>Demanding Performance - Front Line</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Challenges</strong><br> Developing the performance parameters for front line team members (Associate level ) has always been the challenging one. The client have has finding it difficult the decide the group level appraisal system. At the end of the year a format is sent to the HoD/ Section Head and asked to give the rating of all front line team members. Difficult to justify the rating as no parameters to measure. More perception based rather than objectivity. Level of dissatisfaction among employees.</p>

<p><strong>TPP approach </strong><br>
TPP has introduced research based performance management system for the front line team members. This is based on credit system. All together 9 areas based on PQCDSEM and discipline and participation have been identified and total 21 areas have been selected.  The performance parameters and targets and discussed with the person concerned and agreed.</p> 

<p>There is credit and debit point. In the beginning of the appraisal period 100 points are credited and there is provision of debit and bonus points. In case there  is non-conformity / deviation then there is pro rata basis deduction of points in decimal and at the same time for giving bonus for good points. overall 25 points bonus given to employees for the good work. One can get points upto 125 with additional bonus points.</p>

<p>The transparency in target setting and employees knows which work would add bonus and which non conformity would get the point deducted , this has given confidence to employees and there is increase in productivity and performance. overall per person the productivity has gone up.</p>  

<p><strong>Clients Benefits </strong><br>
There is trust , respect and reliability. Overall productivity and performance has increased. There is openness and transparency. The wastage has been reduced and productivity has increased. For last 2 years there have been consistent result and also implemented in other group companies.</p>

<p><strong>Challenges </strong><br>
It is always challenge for us to increase the per person productivity and performance. the salary and wages bill has gone up however the productivity and performances have remained the same. Specially is a situation , where there is not much business growth and wages bills are increasing. Either it is middle level or junior level  , the challenges remains the same. In case of white collar – the middle level employees, it becomes very difficult to increase the productivity and performance. we are talking about integrated approach of productivity and performance when the total factor productivity and performance is there.</p>

<p><strong>TPP approach</strong><br>
We have worked with number of clients in improving the work efficiency and effectiveness. The senior and middle level efficiency improvement have been for the functional heads as well as sectional heads. We have focused on increasing the value add. Focusing on value added activity and removing the non value added.</p>

<p>The focus has been on understanding the complete processes and sub processes and the present job performance. Activities and sub activities being carried out and redefining the same as per business need. We have followed TPPP operating model as well as DDAMAIR approach. There were number of activities which were not adding value or time spent was more. Through the target setting processes streamlined the system and mentored and coached to focus on value add services.</p>   

<p>The potential analysis of individual has been done and the competence level to deliver the result has also been measured. Specially in an old organization , where the employees have risen from rank. There has been change in customer demand ,however we still keep performing the same. The job enlargement and job enrichment has been done. 
</p>

<p><strong>Clients’ benefits </strong><br>
 There has been tremendous changes in the organization. With the same person / salary bill the output ratio has increased. The same employee has started delivering the better result and higher value add. Overall productivity and performance has increased.</p>

    <p> <strong>Challenges </strong><br>
With front line at the shop floor there have been different challenges. Overall the cell / line productivity and performance has not increased.  The number of people have gone up or remained same , however there is not much change in production. There is also shop floor rejection and rework. Waste is high and  employee accountability is not there. There has been different types of losses at the shop floor. In certain cases there has also been the delivery failure. The dispatch to the customer could not be done on time. The wages bill is going up however the production is not realized.</p>

<p>There is always higher expectation from employees for salary increase, how to compensate the same. In certain cases organization engaged the off roll employees but that is not the solution. </p>

<p><strong>TPP approach </strong><br>
By following 20 steps approach , we have been able to increase the shop floor productivity and performance. the focus has been removing the shop floor loses and improving the productivity and performance. we do carry out the time and motion study for the same. There are more than 16 losses on which we have been working. Improving overall equipment efficiency (OEE).</p>

<p>Improved the inter-department and intra- department coordination and planning, there has been focus on people skill and competence. Based on gap analysis the skill development initiative have been taken.</p>  

<p>Employees' involvement through kaizen and suggestions also helped the organization to improve overall shop floor efficiency . We have seen that employees ideas and  support have been great for improving the overall shop floor efficiency and improvement. </p>

<p><strong>Clients’ benefits</strong><br>
More than 20 percent increase in productivity and performance at the shop floor has been achieved. Overall productivity and quality improved. The number of rejection and rework cases went down. Even there have been improvement in delivery to the customer. Overall sales achieved and margin improved.</p>

    <p>  Developing competencies in the form of leadership has been key achievement of TPP. In last one decade number of leadership projects have been completed. </p>

<p><strong>Challenges </strong><br>
Leadership development at top and middle level is the challenging one. To deliver the productivity and performance and achieve the desired business result, it is very much required that the business leaders as well as the functional leaders play an important role. There has always been performance gap, which has been addressed by the leadership development project. Leaders have been developed across the level, be it front level or middle or top level. Through TPP initiatives, number of success stories have been developed.</p>

<p><strong>TPP Approach </strong><br>
TPP has developed research based leadership development approach which is based on TPPP and MSK operating model. We focus both on hard and soft elements. Based on potential analysis of each team members the intervention and feedback is decided. There are 3 classroom modules – Win-Win, Manthan and Mala which are conducted in a gap of 60 days from each module supported by in-depth analysis and report. There has been in-depth understanding of all particiaptns during the programme and after the programme and based on initiative undertaken and initiative shown, the development plan has been prepared by TPP team. There are 10 points development plan , which is monitored and analyzed. The activity and analysis is designed and developed by TPP. Complete adult learning processes have been followed. </p>

<p>The multi-dimensional analysis is done based on involvement during the programme, activity being carried out , home work done , behavior /improvement done at the work place, all are considered. There is always scope for each and every individual to discuss and agree for the same. </p>

<p><strong>Clients’ benefits</strong><br>
Breakthrough result have been achieved. there has been increase in overall productivity and performance. Accountable team developed which have been able to deliver the desired result. The team has also been able to develop others in their work areas and carried out the improvement.</p>

   <p>Front line team development has been always an unique experience for TPP. There has been always new learning and scope for implementing new ideas. There have been number of projects which we have completed for overall development off front line team leaders and team members.</p> 

<p><strong>Challenges </strong><br>
Business leaders and functional leaders doing their best to improve the overall productivity and performance as well as business result. The support of front line team leaders and team members are very much required. They understand very well what is required to be done for each machine and method as well as how to improve the shop floor productivity and performance. Developing the accountable team at the front level is the challenging one. SMART People Good work is the mantra of success. SMART – Self Confident; Motivated; Assertive, Reasoning; Team Player and Good Work – High in quality , low in cost, on time delivery , total safety and 5S.</p>

<p><strong>TPP approach </strong><br>
TPP has developed an integrated MSK operating model which has been successfully implemented for developing the front line competence. The total project duration is for 120 days consisting of 4 days class room intervention of 2 modules – Jeet Hi Jeet and Manthan. Each module conducted between a gap of 60 days. Based on people potential development the development plan is prepared and implemented. There has been home work followed by shop floor visit and discussion. 
 The basic approach is to ignite the fire within. Develop a sense of accountability and change. Keep focusing on continual improvement and employees participation through ideas and suggestions.  Feedback and encouragement is the key point of success. There has been total involvement at the shop floor. </p> 

<p><strong>Clients’ benefits </strong><br>
Overall there has been very encouraging result at the shop floor. Improvements in productivity and performance. The level of customer satisfaction increased. Employee involvement and commitment created a sense of responsible was developed, which in turn resulted in overall business growth and employees satisfaction followed by rewards and recognition.  </p>
