   <p class="justify">Based on Business Plan and departmental objective we have to set the individual KRAs ( Key Result Areas ) or KPI  (Key Performance Indicator).</strong></p>
   <p>This is very important document. The KRA setting processes are very challenging one.  It has to be set based on business requirement. Overall the coverage of all points and alignment is important. </p>
   <p>For Senior and Middle level this is decided at the individual level, however in case of front line it may be decided on the basis of team / line.</p>
   <p>Mainly consider the </p>
   <ol>
    <li>Key performance indicators/ areas</li>
    <li>Action Point, </li>
    <li>Unit of measurement  </li>
    <li>Existing level/ status,</li>
    <li>Target range, </li>
    <li>Weight age, </li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>Set the SMART target ( specific, measurable, achievable, reasonable, tangible/ time bound). The Functional  Head and Subordinate decide the same and agree.</p>
   <p>It is suggested to decide the tentative target for the year and firm target for the quarter. It is always good to work for the quarter and appraise the same, specially at the senior level.  For each quarter the total points  may be 100 weight age 25 percent for each quarter. </p>
   
   <p>For senior and middle level , the review to be connected on monthly basis. On the basis of gap analysis in performance, the feedback and counseling is done and support provided by the management. It is more to make the person successful in achieving the targets and goals rather not achieving the same.</p>
   <p>Based on evaluation, the rewards and recognition and career plan is also  considered. </p>
