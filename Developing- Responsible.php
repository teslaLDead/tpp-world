    <li>Manpower deployment </li>
     <li>Demanding performance and </li>
    <li>Bridging the performance gap </li>
   </ol>
   
   <p>All are management responsibility. Employees come and punche the card, there are very few who own the work and start by self. By and large employees  to be engaged and deployed.  </p>
   <p>Developing performing culture, innovation, leadership, vision, mission, business plans – all are management role. </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Delivering performance </li>
    </ul>
      
      <p>This is with the employee. Employees across all levels to be made accountable for- see it , do it , solve it and own it. The ownership part is with the employee, making employee accountable is still with the management. To get the result this is very important.  </p>
