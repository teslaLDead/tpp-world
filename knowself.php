<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; •	I have to live for 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; •	I have to work for 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; •	I have to think for
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; •	I have to leave a legacy for 
</p>
<p class="text-justify">All 4 factors to be addressed. Unless we know the answer of all 4 question we would not be successful in life. We may work hard however the success would not be achieved. TPP supports in defining the purpose of life. </p>

<div id="b">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-2">follow 4 Hs</span></h3>
<p class="text-justify">The second process of change is to connect 4 Hs – Hand with Heart , Head and Habit. We have got the hand, which has to be connected with heart first rather than head. Head to be connected after connecting with heart. Then comes the habit – which  is a part of change. Connecting the hand with head, would not bring commitment and engagement. It is a separate activity. With self and others , connect the head with heart first , develop love and affection then the work starts. </p>

<div id="c">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-3">The fire within</h3>
<p class="text-justify">The fire is within. Whatever the changes is required , the journey starts from within. We have to start believing first that yes there would be change. Unless we believe first the changes would not be taking place. The self belief is the first step of change. We have the start believing and owning the consequences, whether it is good or bad, be ready for this then the change would take place. Unless we own and start the work , the changes would not happen. Even to travel a journey of 100 km,  few steps have to be taken then the journey gets  completed</p>

<div id="d">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-4">Motivation </h3>
<p class="text-justify">As discussed and said the motivation first. Self motivation is the fuel which would keep you moving and moving and thriving for the direction and change. Self motivation is best motivation. What others say would also impact you , however how do you take those points would equally matter for you. The inner motivation would last long, from outside it would keep changing / fluctuating as the day changes. TPP supports in making you self motivated. </p>

<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-5">Empathy</h3>
<p class="text-justify">One has to use the wisdom of empathy. Emotion would not always work. The sympathy would make you to carried away by the situation. One need to follow the empathy, be with for time being and move. One need not to do the work for others, let other do for self. Don’t give fish , teach how to fish rather than giving the solution , we need to give the alternatives and let the person select what is the best  so that the success and failures goes with the person not with you. Always focus on process not the person. The process be correct, result may or may not be achieved, however the process need to be correct. </p>

<div id="f">
<h3 class="secand-sec-bluebg heading-sec-6">Winning Attitude</h3>
<p class="text-justify">For personal excellence, the foundation is winning attitude. Whatever work has been done , the journey begins with winning attitude.  We have to look for the winning way. It is assumed that we all are positive in nature, however the important factor is winning attitude. Never thought of losing one. Always strive to make others to feel win-win. It is the mindset which we have to set in the winning way. Even the defeat to be treated an opportunity to learn and improve. Impossible to be always seen as I am possible. </p>
