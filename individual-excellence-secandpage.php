<h2 class="secand-sec-bluebg expert padding-2">2 Know Self</h2>
<p>The journey of change starts from self. One need to understand self about who I am and what I want to do. Number of time we blame others for the failure , whereas the success and failure is within. We did not understand what we require and then we did the work. To whom to blame, not others but self. One need to understand very clear cut about self. </p>
<p><strong>2.1.1 Purpose of life </strong></p>
<p>The journey of life begins from purpose of life : 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; •	I have to live for 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; •	I have to work for 
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; •	I have to think for
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; •	I have to leave a legacy for 
</p>
<p>All 4 factors to be addressed. Unless we know the answer of all 4 question we would not be successful in life. We may work hard however the success would not be achieved. PPI supports you in defining the purpose of life. </p>
<div class="main-div main-div-shadow"><p>2.1.1.1 Define purpose </p></div>

<p><strong>2.1.2 follow 4 Hs</strong></p>
<p>The second process of change is to connect 4 Hs – Hand with Heart , Head and Habit. We have got the hand, which has to be connected with heart first rather than head. Head to be connected after connecting with heart. Then comes the habit – which  is a part of change. Connecting the hand with head, would not bring commitment and engagement. It would be a separate activity. With self and others , connect the head with heart first , develop love and affection then the work would start. </p>
<p><strong>2.1.3 The fire within</strong></p>
<p>The fire is within. Whatever the changes is required , the journey starts from within. We have to start believing first that yes there would be change. Unless we believe first the changes would not be taking place. The self belief is the first step of change. We have the start believing and owning the consequences, whether it is good or bad.  Be ready for this then the change would take place. Unless we own and start the work , the changes would not happen. Even to travel a journey of 100 km. few steps have to be taken then the journey would be completed</p>

<p><strong>2.1.4 Motivation </strong></p>
<p>As discussed and said the motivation first. Self motivation is the fuel which would keep you moving and moving and thriving for the direction and change. Self motivation is best motivation. What others say would also impact you , however how do you take those points would equally matter for you. The inner motivation would last long, from outside it would keep changing / fluctuating as the day changes. PPI supports in making you self motivated. </p>

<p><strong>2.1.5 Empathy </strong></p>
<p>One has to use the wisdom of empathy. Emotion would not always work. The sympathy would make you to carried away by the situation. One need to follow the empathy, be with for time being and move. One need not to do the work for others, let other do for self. Don’t give fish , teach how to fish rather than giving the solution , we need to give the alternatives and let the person select what is the best  so the success and failures goes with the person not with you. Always focus on process not the person. The process be correct, result may or may not be achieved, however the process need to be correct. </p>

<p><strong>2.1.6 Winning Attitude </strong></p>
<p>For personal excellence, the foundation is winning attitude. Whatever work has been done , the journey begins with winning attitude.  We have to look for the winning way. It is assumed that we all are positive in nature, however the important factor is winning attitude. Never thought of losing one. Always strive to make others to feel win-win. It is the mindset which we have to set in the winning way. Even the defeat to be treated an opportunity to learn and improve. Impossible to be always seen as I am possible. </p>

<div id="b">
<h2 class="secand-sec-bluebg expert padding-2">2.2 Set goals </h2>
<p>Goals and targets are important in life. It is the not the distance, the direction is important in life. Whatever we have done, it all depends on targets and goals. Time and resources are limited, we have to utilize the best. We have to set the targets and goals in personal, professional, organzatinal and social life. All are important for us. As we progress in our life these goals and targets keep changing. This is dynamic one and one need to review and change as per need of the hour. We have to keep the dynamic one. The SMART goals and targets to be set for us. </p>

<p><strong>2.2.1 - 4 Phases of life</strong> </p>
<p>There are 4 phases of life an 4 areas , we need to set the goals and targets for all phases and areas of life. We need to focus on overall success of life. There has to be balanced growth in life. Personal , professional , organizational and social , all are important for us. As we move from different phases of life from childhood to adult hood , we have to define the goals and targets of each stages. </p>

<p><strong>2.2.2 phases of life</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>2.2.3 set SMART goals and targets </strong> </p>
<p>Set you SMART  goals and targets. </p>
<p><strong>S- Specific</strong> – what we want to achieve – be specific  
<br><strong>M- Measurable</strong> – always set the target in measurable terms 
<br><strong>A – Achieve able</strong> – the target should be achieve able – it should be realistic in nature and able to achieve the same 
<br><strong>R – reasonable / realistic</strong> – make it more reasonable and realistic one , keep as close as it is possible to achieve. This would boost up your success 
<br><strong>T – time bound / time line</strong> – set it a time bound and timeline, never keep open ended 
<br>We need to follow all these mantra. </p>

<p><strong>2.2.4 manage your time </strong> </p>
<p>Just setting the goals and targets are not enough to give the result, what is important to mange you time. Need to understand what is normal, important and urgent. At given time number of work to be done, how to prioritize them . A decision making process is required, we may decide to leave or delegate some of the work which we may not like to do would not be adding higher value. A continuous efforts to be made for achieving the same. </p>

<p><strong>2.2.5 do the time management </strong> </p>
<p>Time management is very important. Number of time the Procrastination ( delay of work ) or not understanding the urgency of work , we have to pray huge price for the same. Taking the right decision at right time and with the right person is the wisdom. Wisdom is very important factor in our life. We need to develop the clear cut wisdom and goals in our life. </p>

<h2 class="secand-sec-bluebg expert padding-2">2.3 Go to the root  </h2>
<p>Get to the root is the mantra of success. We rarely go to the root. We need to understand the reason and symptom of the challenges / problem – why it is happening . we never go to the root and based on our own past experiences or someone else suggestion we do the work or take a decision which always becomes a point of regret or sorrow. We have to go to the root by using tools and technique. For each reason there has to be proper analysis. We cannot adopt the shortcut method  , which is always a trouble for us.  Do is first time right is the mantra of success. Develop alternatives and work on that </p>

<p><strong>2.3.1 Accept the challenges – follow 3 Is </strong></p>
<p>There is mantra of 3 Is- Involve, Improve and Impact. We need to start the journey of change from “NO” to be read as “N.O.” –new opportunity. Always we have to see the new opportunity when others day no. get involved and improve the situation whatever is there. We have to get involve and impact the situation with change. This is connecting the hand with heart and head. The mantra of change to be written first. </p>

<p><strong>2.3.2. Go to the root </strong></p>
<p>Get to the root . use the tool “why- why” seems to be easy however difficult one. When we face any situation , always ask that why this situation has arisen and get to the root . the gut feel would not work , need not to trust on perception , go to the root otherwise the same challenges / problem would arise / emerge again and again and we would not be able to move forward and take up the another challenge. </p>

<p><strong>2.3.3 Use of tools and technique</strong></p>
<p>Data and facts are very important. Without data and facts whatever decision is taken it is more the gut feel based rather than the fact. It would always be inconsistent and not the sustainable one. Collect all data and information and do the analysis. It would support in understanding the trend an taking the right decision based on data and facts.  The number or majority would not work. Use of data and record always shows the trend and we intend to take the decision based on that. The data need to be more realistic and based on facts. </p>

<p><strong>2.3.4 Decision making process  </strong></p>
<p>The key differentiator of success and failure is decision making- taking the right decision at the right time. Decision and time both are important. Number to time we take decision however we are not taken on right time. There are number of tools and technique for decision making and we need to use those tools and technique. ABC analysis and matrix diagram or paired compassion are common one. We have to always work with the alternatives. Unless there is alternatives , decision would be not be rational and we would be biased. Always develop Plan “A” and Plan “B”</p>
<div class="main-div main-div-shadow"><p>2.3.4.1 Decision making tools and technique  </p></div>

<p><strong>2.3.5 Creativity and innovation</strong></p>
<p>While making decision and working on any challenges , the creativity and innovation plays an important role. We have to be creative in our approach and actions. Use of SCAMPER method ( Substitute, combine, alter, modify, put to other use, Eliminate and Reverse are very common one. We have to keep trying to use these tools and technique. Creativity and innovation is the mantra of success. This would always bring new to the concept and understanding. </p>

<h2 class="secand-sec-bluebg expert padding-2">2.4 Connect with others</h2>
<p>We are good to self, however without connecting with others, we would not be successful in our life. This is a skill and art of connecting with others. We need to know how to connect with others. We have to connect with 2 or more person and then connect with number of people. Communication plays an important role in this. We have to follow 3 Cs Concept : – Connect- Communicate – Commitment. </p>

<p><strong>2.4.1 Follow 3 Cs – connect – communicate – commitment </strong> </p>
<p>3Cs always supports in success. Before we communicate with others , we need to connect with others. Know the person name , his background and interest . greet him / her first before starting the communication.  We have to connect first and when there is willingness from the person or the person is ready then start communicating. All communication must end with commitment – what next – what is going to be done after this . what we require to do the next and when we would be back. There is need to follow up. </p>

<p><strong>2.4.2 Assertive communication skills </strong></p> 
<p>The communication with others to be assertive. We need not be aggressive or passive in our communication. Our tone, boy language , gesture and distance between the 2 or more should be equal. There is no need to become aggressive in our approach . develop the habit of good listening and understanding . understand first then speak. The listening is an art and it has to be practices. Becoming aggressive time and again becomes barrier in communication and it also affects our relations with others. </p>

<p><strong>2.4.3 Develop interpersonal skills </strong> </p>
<p>Interpersonal skills are important in our life. A successful person always develops good interpersonal skills. We need to follow the chakra of interpersonal skills. We have to deal with seniors, juniors, colleagues, and customers / friends . we need to follow the basis rules of how to manage the relations. We need to fulfill each other needs, not the demand. The effective relationship is developed based on fulfilling each other needs. </p>

<p><strong>2.4.4 Managing conflict and stress</strong></p>
<p>Conflict and stress is very natural one. We cannot always expect the goody-goody situation, whenever there would be two or more people the conflict is bound to arise. We have to manage the conflict and stress. We don’t have to part of conflict and stress. We need to carry out as a process. There is need to get concluded. We need to keep it open ended and reactive in our approach. There is need to discuss in a healthy way and reach on conclusion. In case of any differences, the matter issues may be parked for time being and when there is appropriate time then it may discussed and resolved. Undue pressure always gets converted into conflict / stress. </p>

<p><strong>2.4.5 Develop win-win situation </strong> </p>
<p>Always follow the mantra of win –win. There should be something for others too. Be honest in your approach and follow the same. Honesty and integrity always builds a long term relations. There is no need to develop a hidden agenda for the same. Maintain the transparency and need not to harm others. Need not to harm others. </p>

<h2 class="secand-sec-bluebg expert padding-2">2.5 Lead from front </h2>
<p>In life legacy is very important. Whatever we do it has got an impact on others. First of all we need to move from an individual to a team members , more than 2 and then become the team player and finally leader , setting an example for others to follow. All cannot become a leader , however it is very important to be a team member. We may not support others blindly, however not moving alone. Connect with others. What people remember is the good work. Whatever we do ,  we need to make an impact on others. Be ready to move with team. </p>

<p><strong>2.5.1 Follow 3 Ls – lead , led and learnt  </strong> </p>
<p>We need to lead – led and learnt. We need to follow others as well as make others to follow the same. Whatever people we have or whatever the number of people we have we have to make other to move and also others to follow you in given area of work and specialization. Always look for an opportunity to come forward and take the initiative. Whatever experiences we have had , we need to share with others. Always followers would not bring the good result. All are capable of doing something let others to follow. </p>

<p><strong>2.5.2 Move from group to team  </strong></p> 
<p>Always form the team not the group. Try to think big and plan big for all. Working in a given pocket or selected people would not be helpful. We may form small team , however group is not desirable. We need to not develop our own agenda and work for that. The decision taken in a team to be honored and respected. There is no need to conflict or compete with each others, the need is to complement and support each others. All decisions are not the correct decision, however once the decision is taken let the team decide or modify. We need to abide by decision taken and follow the same. There is need to be winning attitude for the same. </p>

<p><strong>2.5.3 Be a team players – move from individual to team </strong> </p>
<p>Team player- very important aspect. We need to form a team and move. Team is always better than the individual. We say that the sum is greater than the number. Be a team player. Even those who don’t intend to come and form the team , call them and make them a part of the team . team always brings the better result. There is shared responsibility and everyone is sharing some part of the responsibility. Team norms are bigger than individual likes an dislikes. While forming team , storming would always be there however we need to storm and then make it performing. When we start performing then storming gets converted into normalization. Never speak about others back to it , always speak in front in a positive manner. </p>

<p><strong>2.5.4 Lead from front   </strong></p>
<p>Come forward and take the initiative. All team members need to come forward and take the imitative. It should be only selected / nominated leader to perform , however based your specialization and key strength, need to come forward and take the responsibility. Lead the team in one or another way. Always give chance to others to perform and show the result. Everyone is capable one and he / she would perform. The pace or result may be different however positive result would be there. Show respect and patience to others. </p>

<p><strong>2.5.5  Set an example for others </strong></p>
<p>Be an individual or team always set an example for others. Let others follow the same. We have to work for legacy of good example. All have got the potential to perform and we have to set example for others to follow. The success stories / good example to be shared among others and let other follows the same. We need keep adding value to the Nation, Society, Organization , Family and self. </p>
